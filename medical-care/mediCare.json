      "description": "Radiology is a medical specialty that uses different kinds of imaging to diagnose and treat disease.Peter Mac uses the following radiology services to help diagnose and treat a variety of cancer types:A CT scan is a medical imaging procedure that uses x-rays and digital computer technology to create 2D or 3D images of the body. Unlike other forms of medical imaging, CT can make an image of every type of body structure at once, including bone, blood vessels and soft tissue.CT scans can be used to diagnose cancer and plan surgeries or radiation therapy treatments. CT scans are also used to monitor response to cancer treatment. CT can be used as a visual aid for procedures, such as biopsies, that go inside the body, to ensure correct placement.At Peter Mac, we perform more than 45 CT examinations per day, consisting mostly of whole-body scans (chest, abdomen, pelvis, often including neck)."

      "description": " Radiation therapy is a form of cancer treatment that uses radiation (x-rays).Radiation therapy may be given on its own, or with other forms of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or surgery. Like having an x-ray picture, radiation therapy is painless.Radiation therapy is a localized treatment, which means that it generally only affects the part of your body that requires treatment. Most of the time radiation therapy needs to be delivered over a number of days or weeks. The majority of our patients come to Peter Mac for about half an hour each day, and are otherwise able to maintain their usual activities. The radiation therapy team works together to ensure the best approach to suit your individual needs."
